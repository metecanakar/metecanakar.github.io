My name is Mete Can Akar. I am computer scientist working as a professional machine learning engineer, currently living in Heilbronn, Germany. I've been programming for at least 10 years, making a living from it for at least 6 years. It's been an interesting and varied journey: from mobile and web development (fullstack) written in Java, C# Javascript, SQL, to big data and data science using Python and R. All these are covered in my resume.
